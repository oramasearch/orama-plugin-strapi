# Orama Cloud plugin for Strapi

[![Build](https://github.com//askorama/orama-plugin-strapi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com//askorama/orama-plugin-strapi/actions/workflows/build.yml)


## Introduction

This [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) plugin integrates Orama Cloud's search and answers engine into your Strapi application, providing
seamless search capabilities.

## Installation (via package manager)

### v5

* npm
 ```sh
    npm install @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@latest
 ```
* yarn
 ```sh
    yarn add @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@latest
 ```
* pnpm
 ```sh
    pnpm add @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@latest
 ```

### v4
* npm
 ```sh
    npm install @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@^1.0.0
 ```
* yarn
 ```sh
    yarn add @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@^1.0.0
 ```
* pnpm
 ```sh
    pnpm add @oramacloud/plugin-strapi@^1.0.0
 ```

### Installation (via Strapi Marketplace)

1. Go to your Strapi administration dashboard.
2. Navigate to the `Marketplace` section.
3. Search for `Orama Cloud` and install the plugin.

## Configuration

Configure the plugin in the `config/plugins.js` file:

```js
// config/plugins.js

module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "orama-cloud": {
    config: {
      privateApiKey: env('ORAMA_PRIVATE_API_KEY'),
    },
  },
});
```

Your `ORAMA_PRIVATE_API_KEY` will be automatically generated when you create the index. You can also generate a new Private API Key in [Developer tools](https://cloud.orama.com/developer-tools) page on Orama Cloud.

## Usage

Configure and manage `Collections` that map your Strapi app Content-Types with an Index
on [Orama Cloud](https://cloud.orama.com/indexes).

Check out the documentation: [Connect to Strapi](https://docs.orama.com/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/strapi)

### Creating an index

- Visit Orama Cloud and [Create](https://cloud.orama.com/indexes/create/from-native-integrations) a new index with data source "**Strapi**".
- Once your index is ready, copy your **Private API Key** and configure it in your app's `config/plugins.js` configuration file.
- Copy the `indexId` and visit your Strapi administration dashboard to configure your first collection.

### Managing collections

Collections map your Content-Types on Strapi with an index on Orama Cloud. To keep your index in sync with the data, you
can configure the update settings for each collection.

- Select `Orama Cloud` from your Strapi admin menu to manage your collections.
- Add a new collection.

- Paste your newly created `indexId`.
- Select a **Content Type**.
- (Optional) Specify the related records to include.
- Configure your document schema and your searchable properties.
- Select the Update Settings option:
  - **Live updates** will update your index as soon as any content is created, updated or deleted.
  - **Scheduled job** will automatically update your index at a defined frequency: every 30 minutes, hourly, daily,
    weekly or monthly.

When an index is not in sync with the latest changes in Strapi, the collection status is set to `outdated`.
When the **Scheduled job** is executed, it checks the collection status, to avoid triggering an update if the data is
already in sync. You can always trigger a new deployment manually.

## Advanced usage

### Documents transformation
The scope of the transformation is to modify the document before it is sent to the Orama Cloud API. This can be useful to add, remove or modify fields in the document.
A common use case is to change how a collection is handled (array of objects) to a flat structure [this is not supported by Orama Cloud].
Here is an example of how to transform a collection of objects to a flat structure:

#### Pre-requisites
- An Orama Cloud index.
- A Strapi collection already created, with relations.

Example document:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "owner": "John",
  "cars": [
    {
      "brand": "Toyota",
      "model": "Corolla"
    },
    {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Focus"
    }
  ]
}
```
You can insert your transformer function directly inside the plugin configuration under `config/plugins.js` file:

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "orama-cloud": {
    config: {
      privateApiKey: env("ORAMA_PRIVATE_API_KEY"),
      collectionSettings: {
        your_collection_index_id: {
          /* Mandatory */
          schema: {
            id: { type: "integer" },
            owner: { type: "string" },
            cars: {
              brands: { type: "string" },
              models: { type: "string" },
            },
          },
          /* Mandatory */
          transformer: entry => {
            return {
              ...entry,
              owner: "Overriding owner",
              cars: {
                source: entry.cars,
                ...entry.cars.reduce(car => {
                  acc.brands.push(car.brand);
                  acc.models.push(car.model);
                  return acc;
                }, {
                  brands: [],
                  models: [],
                }),
              },
            }
          },
        }
      }
    },
  },
})
```

In this way your cars will be transformed to:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "owner": "Overriding owner",
  "cars": {
    "brands": ["Toyota", "Ford"],
    "models": ["Corolla", "Focus"]
  }
}
```
And make you car brands and models searchable.

:warning: Both schema and transformer are mandatory.

:warning: The transformer function must return an object with the same schema as the one declared.

:warning: All the properties not declared in it will be included in the document, but ignored while searching.
